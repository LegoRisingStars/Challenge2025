Our Custom UI POC team did an excellent job to prove out that it's feasible to create Custom UI for Duck Creek. We wanted to do a quick POC so team took simplistic approach that uses Duck Creek to drive out most of the UI functionality. Logic behind this approach was that we should know quickly if this was not a qood idea. Now as we are equipped with more data from first phase of POC we are in a position to do some further analysis to decide right approach for implementation. 
We understand that market conditions are pushing us for quick action and it's important to look at all our options and lay a good foundation on which we can continue to build. Here is what POC team used so far and here is recommended approach for actual implementation but we will need some more research to answer additional questions that are needed for actual implementation
